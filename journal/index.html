                <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies</h2> 
                <time datetime="2026-02-08">February 8, 2026</time>

                <p>For our next project, we will be using and integrating imagery into the webpage that we will be building. And being able to understand and interpret imagery is just as important and being able to interpret text, especially in an imagery heavy project. I started by reading this <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">article</a>  from The New York Times which explores just how important visual thinking skills are, and different ways to help boost your own understanding and thoughts about the images that you see. Interpretation based on the provided context is an extremely useful skill to have. </p>

                <p>Often imagery is used to supplement text, but what happens when imagery becomes the primary focus on the web or even the conveyer of information. One example of this that I found is the <a href="https://immersive-g.com/">landing page</a> for the company Immersive Garden, who makes highly interactive digital spaces on the web. As you scroll, more textual information is slowly revealed but also imagery appears in the background. Similarly, as you move your cursor around, pieces of the background become visible. This is an interesting interactive element that is quite pretty, but I find that all the moving parts can be challenging for a regular computer to process and display efficiently. </p>

                <h2>Best Practices for Overlays</h2> 
                <time datetime="2026-01-28">January 28, 2026</time>

                <p>To learn a bit more about overlays and their usage I read an <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">article</a> from Medium which discussed the best practices for working with them. I found this insightful as overlays can be used very effectively for separating certain types of information or certain actions that you are taking on a website. Interestingly enough, I never really considered how unhelpful they can be on a mobile application, but it makes sense because of how small of an area is being worked with. I will say that there are many types of overlays I have come across that are just completely annoying, such as pop-ups when I first access a website. Or when it forces me to choose an option instead of just choosing to exit or close it out. </p>

                <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2> 
                <time datetime="2026-01-18">January 18, 2026</time>

                <p>While reading through this first <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">article</a> about best practices on the web, I was quite shocked just how many guidelines there are for utilizing forms. It also made me critically think about my own experiences with filling out forms and often how confusing they can be. Let alone having to create one where many types of information is needed, and it all needs to be formatted correctly and in an accessible way! I definitely have had a lot of trouble with confusing or vague feedback when trying to submit. Personally, one of the most significant annoyances is the fact that way too many forms do not accept hyphens, and there is one in my legal name. Sigh…</p>

                <p>But I digress. What really stood out to me was the importance of labeling and keeping them visible at all times so the user knows what they are filling in at a certain moment and don’t have to clear the field in case they walk away and forget. Plus there are so many options for where it can go. Interestingly, my choice for a <a href="https://munespice.com/pages/contact">website</a> that employs best practices might break the rules slightly, but I think it does it in an effective way that doesn’t hinder the function. This contact form submission page is very simple with two small fields and one large field. All of them have the labels in the fields interestingly enough, but when the user clicks on each of the fields, the label shrinks and moves up slightly. This way it keeps the labelling but it also takes up less space. Additionally the ‘send’ button has a slight animation that provides a form of feedback when pressed and the site will indicate when a field needs to be filled out if you attempt to submit prematurely. </p>
